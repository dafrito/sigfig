* Parameterize SigFig on a value type. 

Right now, we force SigFigs to all be doubles. This is okay, but it'd be
nice if we could do something like:

SigFig<FixedPoint> a;
SigFig<long> a;

I'm not sure how hard it would be to do this, in practice. Without it, we're
stuck with doubles, which is satisfacotry.
